Here are some major features of the braille printing machine.
* Use of tinyG(ATMLE xmega192a3u) hardware as a controller for the machine.
* 2 stepper motors for x and y axis,
* Accepts Gcode from USB ports and interprets it.
* A solenoid linear actuator is used to emboss braille dots into the paper.
* Use of chillipeppr to visualize work on progress.

Operating Steps
After the machine has been assembled, the following steps are done to print on braille script:


1. Use Braillerap to generate Gcode  
2. Conditioning and reviewing Gcode for correctness.
3. Power the braille printer and connect it to the interface.
4. Load Gcode into the interface and send it to the machine.
5. Load the paper, manage it, and print on the paper.
